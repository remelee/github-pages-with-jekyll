One of the things I do is volunteer. Since eighth grade, when I first became eligible, I have helped to volunteer at my church. Most of the time, I help out with the summer camp, instructing the kids or watching them. I have also helped out with Sunday school before. This year, however, I joined Key Club which is a volunteering organization. Through this club, I have raised money and food for people in need and helped to bring smiles to people's faces. I also helped to transcribe documents for the Smithsonian. 

Another fact about me is that I enjoy music. I know how to play two instruments, though technically three if you count the recorder. I started playing the piano and the violin in elementary school. I was part of the school orchestra for six years, and I still play the violin in my spare time. 

During the summer of 2019, I attended a STEM summer camp. In the camp, I created a laptop using Raspberry Pi materials. On top of that, I also learned how to code in python. This camp helped to comfirm my interest in programming and STEM related courses.
